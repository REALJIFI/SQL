# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table where i inserted Spotify data 
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#who are the top 15 artist with the loudest song
SELECT artist_name, loudness, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY loudness
ORDER BY loudness ASC
LIMIT 15;

#What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
, MAX(duration_ms) as time
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#what is the track and name of the best 20 artist with highest live perfomance,danceability,and stage perfomance energy.
SELECT artist_name, track_name
,MAX(liveness) AS live
,MAX(danceability) AS showoff 
,MAX(energy) AS ginger
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY live DESC
LIMIT 20;
